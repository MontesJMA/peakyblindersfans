                        <span class="span">Arthur W Shelby Jr.</span> is the eldest of the Shelby siblings and a tough member of the Peaky Blinders and the Deputy Vice President of Shelby Company Limited. He is also a member of the ICA and acts as his brother Tommy Shelby's right hand man. He is addict to the coke.
                        Arthur is more brawn than brains. During the war in France, Arthur was a Sapper with his brother Thomas, digging very treacherous tunnels in order to place enormous amount of explosives under the enemy positions: a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect at both the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme.
