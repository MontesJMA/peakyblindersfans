                       <span class="span"> Grace Helen Shelby (n√©e Burgess) </span> was an Irish barmaid who took up employment at The Garrison Pub, and secretly operated as an undercover agent for the Birmingham Police. Her mission involved getting close to Thomas Shelby whom she fell in love with. He too returned the sentiment but was heartbroken when he discovered her treachery.

Having left for New York, Grace returns mid-way through 1922, married to an American, but when she reunited with Thomas, it was clear their prior feelings have not dissipated. The somewhat awkward reunion easily culminated into a brief tryst which led to Grace's pregnancy. She married Thomas sometime in 1924, following her first husband's suicide.

She was later murdered from a bullet that was meant for Thomas Shelby. After the incident she continued to haunt Thomas with her memories, who had not been able to get over her death.
